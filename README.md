this was done as part of TOP, the goal was to create a console based Rock,Paper,Scissors game.
the only issue i currently know i need to fix is the user input is case sensitive after the first letter, the first letter is not case sensitive but the rest of the word is
i will fix this in the future, if you find any other bugs please let me know.

this project helped me learn diffrent parts of java script, working with functions was fun yet challanging.
i also dipped my toes into the water on learning how loops worked inorder to paly the game 5 times.

***********How to play***********
1) load the live preview
2) give the input rock paper or scissors, repeat diffrent (or the same) inputs for 5 rounds
3) open the console, you will be able to see what rounds you won and what ones you lost
  you will also see if you won or lost the game as a whole.
